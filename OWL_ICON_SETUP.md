# Owl Icon Setup

To add the owl icon to your website:

1. Save the owl image as `owl-icon.png` in the `/public` folder
2. The icon will automatically appear in:
   - The navbar (logo)
   - The hero section on the home page
   - The registration page header
   - The footer
   - As the favicon (browser tab icon)

If the owl icon file is not found, the website will automatically fallback to the original `ngnhacks.png` logo.

## Image Requirements

- Format: PNG
- Recommended size: 256x256 pixels or larger (square)
- Location: `/public/owl-icon.png`
- The image will be automatically resized as needed
